        <p>Cielito Zamora Senior High School (CZSHS) Robotics Organization is a group  whose members  focuses on engaging and exciting mentor-based programs which build science, engineering, mathematics, and technology skills, that inspire innovation and foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence. It is aligned with the objective of the robotics field to create intelligent machines that can assist humans in a variety of ways.</p>

        <p>    In the year 2020 in the midst of the global pandemic, it started as a small club out of interest and passion as a result of the Division Training of Robotics Trainers using the EV3 Core Set at SDO Caloocan last March 2020.</p>
            
        <p>    Since then, it teaches robotics in a fun and easy manner to senior high school students to participate in related conventions and national competitions in order to create  awareness of technology.</p>
            
        <p>    It addresses practical use and benefits of robotics in education to include more real life applications, such as social interaction and skills; improve critical thinking skills and problem solving capabilities; improve reasoning and skills related to physics and math; higher levels of engagement and improvement in teamwork and interpersonal skills.</p>
